# Embedded-Control-of-Electric-Vehicle-Motor-System

This project handles the sensing and actuation of a 3-phase Brushless DC (BLDC) motor that is commonly used in electric vehicles.
It monitors the state of the vehicle, such as speed, acceleration and light reading, and it handles the start-up, braking and emergency stop for the system.
The setup uses the motor driver, sensor board, and development kit for the Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller.
